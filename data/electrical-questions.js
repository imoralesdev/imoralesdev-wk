        "question": "Which of the following is the minimum requirement of what must be present for current to flow?",
        "options": [
          "A closed path for electrons",
          "A battery and an open circuit",
          "A closed path for electrons and a voltage",
          "A battery or generator"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "A closed path for electrons and a voltage",
        "explanation": "For an electric current to flow, two conditions must be met: (1) a closed path (circuit) for electrons to move through, and (2) a voltage (potential difference) that pushes electrons along. Simply having a closed path is insufficient without a voltage source; an open circuit prevents current flow; and having just a battery or generator without a complete circuit still won’t allow current to flow."
